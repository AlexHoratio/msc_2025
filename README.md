MSc by Research, 2025: Exploring Strain-Level Detail in Faecal Microbiomes of Colorectal Cancer Patients Using Oxford Nanopore Technologies Long-Read Sequencing 

# Plan

1. Unify all my disparate pieces of code (loma_analysis, taxprofiler_r, SRA metadata formatting, Nextflow execution report extractor) and put them in their own folders so that they can be easily organized/maintained/re-used

2. Build graphs and statistics for output from nf-core/taxprofiler, LOMA, and nf-core/mag (if that one works)

# Notes on Data

Actual output files/data are not kept in this repository! You will need to supply your own output files from these pipelines. 

In some cases (such as for metadata processing/integration) this will be extremely bespoke for my project and unlikely to be re-used. Nonetheless, it's kept here for posterity.
